### Hi there, I'm Cédric Bahirwe 👋

### 🎉📖The idea behind this project is to provide a ready-made fully customizable website for developers as well as non-developers, to showcase their portfolio and also have the ability to do blogging.🎉



## ✍🏽 TODOs 💻

- Work on Better Standard Design ( Responsiveness, Colors, ...)
- Build project with Open Source Design thinking (Provide a ready to go website which allows more customizations if needed).
- Work on SEO ( Search Engine Optimization ) and Semantic.

## Known Issues 🧑🏽‍🔧
- Light/Dark Mode Switch state management 
- Mobile Responsiveness
## 🔐 Future Features:

- Build a stable version of the website with a modern technology/framework (thinking of `React` for front-end)
- Implement interactive Basic Bot chatting
- Implement Localization and Translation. (Thinking of `Machine translation` or `Human Translation`)
