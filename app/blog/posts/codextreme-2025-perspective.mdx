As an iOS engineer with a passion for leveraging technology to address real-world challenges, I had the privilege of serving as a mentor and judge at CodeXtreme 2025. This year's hackathon, themed "**Build Things People Need: High-Value, High-Impact Tech Solutions to Shape Communities**" brought together over 250 young tech enthusiasts from various Rwandan universities ([NEWTIMES.CO.RW](https://www.newtimes.co.rw/article/24413/news/featured/featured-codextreme-hackathon-kicks-off-250-young-tech-enthusiasts-tackle-community-challenges)).

## Fostering Innovation Under Time Constraints

Witnessing participants develop functional solutions within a limited timeframe was truly inspiring. The hackathon's structure encouraged rapid ideation and execution, pushing teams to think critically and collaborate effectively. As a mentor, I guided teams in refining their ideas, ensuring alignment with community needs, and navigating technical challenges. This mentorship was crucial in helping participants transform concepts into viable prototypes.

## Evaluating for Real-World Impact

In my role as a judge, I assessed projects based on innovation, technical execution, functionality, theme alignment, and documentation ([CodeXtreme 2025](https://codextreme25.devpost.com/)). The emphasis was on creating solutions that not only showcased technical prowess but also addressed pressing community issues. Projects ranged from AI-driven healthcare applications to blockchain-based financial tools, all aiming to make a tangible difference in society.

## Celebrating Collaborative Problem-Solving

[CodeXtreme 2025](http://CODEXTREME25.DEVPOST.COM) highlighted the power of collaboration and mentorship in driving technological innovation. The event provided a platform for participants to learn from industry experts, exchange ideas, and develop solutions with the potential for significant community impact. As both a mentor and judge, I was honored to contribute to this environment of learning and growth.

## Looking Ahead

The creativity and dedication demonstrated at CodeXtreme 2025 reaffirm my belief in the potential of technology to address societal challenges. I look forward to seeing these young innovators continue to develop their projects and drive positive change within their communities.

I extend my heartfelt gratitude to [CÃ©dric Murairi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cedric-murairi/), Founder of **CodeXtreme**, and the entire [CodeXtreme team](https://www.linkedin.com/company/codextreme/) for their unwavering support and commitment. Their efforts have been crucial in creating an environment where young talents can thrive and make a meaningful impact.

I am excited to witness how these projects evolve and contribute to solving real-world problems.
